See the manual for the procedure to generate a new bitstream with Vivado HD FLow. The first step is to run Tcl_Script_Generator.tcl, with “source Tcl_Script_Generator.tcl –notrace” in the Vivado 2020.1 Tcl Shell, and then “source MakeBitstream.tcl -notrace”. The design checkpoints, *.dcp, in the Implement and Synth subdirectories /top are for the bitstream, top.bit, which was extensively tested. With 25% resolution on the fast PID rolloff frequencies, it does not have timing margin but nonetheless no operational errors were observed in testing. Some modules have had subsequent minor revisions that are not included in those files. The GUI Flow project in the repository, with simplified filter rolloffs, has timing margin.
